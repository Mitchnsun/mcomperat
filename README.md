### How do I get set up? ###

###### Set up ######
* [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/download/), the version should be higher than v0.10.32
> Upgrade Node.js
> * `sudo npm install n -g` - Node version manager
> * `sudo n stable` - For the latest stable version
* npm, the version should be higher than 2.1.8 (Node comes with npm installed). npm is upgrading with Node.js
* Grunt CLI `npm install -g grunt-cli`
> Note that installing grunt-cli does not install the Grunt task runner! The job of the Grunt CLI is simple: run the version of Grunt which has been installed next to a Gruntfile. This allows multiple versions of Grunt to be installed on the same machine simultaneously.
